# Freight-Variation-Chart
An Excel chart that dynamically displays the variation in freight costs for various products. The user selects the months for comparison, and the data is automatically retrieved to visually present the variations in a simple manner. A decrement in the freight is represented as a green arrow (as it results in a lower final product price). An increase is represented as a red arrow.
This project was completed during my social service in the foreign trade department of an important oil company, aimed at analyzing the price behavior of export and import products. The data presented in the document are representative.
